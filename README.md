# Nordigen Python

### ⚠️ Notice
Please be advised that the Bank Account Data libraries are no longer actively updated or maintained. While these libraries may still function, GoCardless will not provide further updates, bug fixes, or support for them.
#

This is official Python client library for [GoCardless Bank Account Data](https://gocardless.com/bank-account-data/) API

For a full list of endpoints and arguments, see the [docs](https://developer.gocardless.com/bank-account-data/quick-start-guide).

Before starting to use API you will need to create a new secret and get your `SECRET_ID` and `SECRET_KEY` from the [GoCardless Bank Account Data Portal](https://bankaccountdata.gocardless.com/user-secrets/).

## Requirements

* Python >= 3.8


## Installation

Install library via pip package manager:

```
pip install nordigen
```

## Example application

Example code can be found in `main.py` file and Flask application can be found in the `example` directory

## Quickstart


```python
from uuid import uuid4

from nordigen import NordigenClient

# initialize Nordigen client and pass SECRET_ID and SECRET_KEY
client = NordigenClient(
    secret_id="SECRET_ID",
    secret_key="SECRET_KEY"
)

# Create new access and refresh token
# Parameters can be loaded from .env or passed as a string
# Note: access_token is automatically injected to other requests after you successfully obtain it
token_data = client.generate_token()

# Use existing token
client.token = "YOUR_TOKEN"

# Exchange refresh token for new access token
new_token = client.exchange_token(token_data["refresh"])

# Get institution id by bank name and country
institution_id = client.institution.get_institution_id_by_name(
    country="LV",
    institution="Revolut"
)

# Get all institution by providing country code in ISO 3166 format
institutions = client.institution.get_institutions("LV")

# Initialize bank session
init = client.initialize_session(
    # institution id
    institution_id=institution_id,
    # redirect url after successful authentication
    redirect_uri="https://gocardless.com",
    # additional layer of unique ID defined by you
    reference_id=str(uuid4())
)

# Get requisition_id and link to initiate authorization process with a bank
link = init.link # bank authorization link
requisition_id = init.requisition_id
```

After successful authorization with a bank you can fetch your data (details, balances, transactions)

---

## Fetching account metadata, balances, details and transactions

```python

# Get account id after you have completed authorization with a bank
# requisition_id can be gathered from initialize_session response
accounts = client.requisition.get_requisition_by_id(
    requisition_id=init.requisition_id
)

# Get account id from the list.
account_id = accounts["accounts"][0]

# Create account instance and provide your account id from previous step
account = client.account_api(id=account_id)

# Fetch account metadata
meta_data = account.get_metadata()
# Fetch details
details = account.get_details()
# Fetch balances
balances = account.get_balances()
# Fetch transactions
transactions = account.get_transactions()
# Filter transactions by specific date range
transactions = account.get_transactions(date_from="2021-12-01", date_to="2022-01-21")
```

## Premium endpoints

```python
# Get premium transactions. Country and date parameters are optional
premium_transactions = account.get_premium_transactions(
    country="LV",
    date_from="2021-12-01",
    date_to="2022-01-21"
)
# Get premium details
premium_details = account.get_premium_details()
```
